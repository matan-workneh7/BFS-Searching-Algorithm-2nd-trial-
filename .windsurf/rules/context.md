you should use this as gide and make sure its fulldilled for the 3 search method:
Project on Searching
-Consider map of Addis Ababa city
- Use the bfs, dfs, greeedy search algorithm to identify the optimal path from the given initial state to the goal state
-So accept initial state and goal state from user, and recommend the optimal path from initial to goal states
-the implementation should consider the following constraints:
What if the initial & goal states are the same?
What if the initial and/or goal state is unknown?
What if you get two or more optimal paths?
and add further at least two constraints
